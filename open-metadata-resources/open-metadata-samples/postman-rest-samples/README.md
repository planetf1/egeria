# Sample Postman Scripts

Postman is a useful tool for testing REST APIs. See https://www.getpostman.com/ for more information about Postman.

It captures, stores and executes specific REST API calls so you do not have to keep typing the URL and parameters
each time you want to issue a request.

## Environment variables

Postman supports the definition of variables like hostname, kafka queue, userId.  These can then be used in specific
postman commands.  This makes it easier for them to be used by multiple users, or with different configurations

## Collections

Collections help to group related REST API calls together.
