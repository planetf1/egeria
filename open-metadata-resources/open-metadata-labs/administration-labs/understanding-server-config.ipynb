    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "ODPi Egeria is an open source project that provides open standards and implementation libraries to connect tools, catalogs and platforms together so they can share information about data and technology.  This information is called metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "Egeria provides servers to manage the exchange of metadata between different technologies. These servers are configured using REST API calls to an Open Metadata and Governance (OMAG) Server Platform.  Each call either defines a default value or configures a service that must run within the server when it is started.\n",
    "\n",
    "As each configuration call is made, the server platform builds up a [configuration document](https://egeria.odpi.org/open-metadata-implementation/admin-services/docs/concepts/configuration-document.html) with the values passed.  When the configuration is finished, the configuration document will have all of the information needed to start the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "The configuration document is deployed to the server platform that is hosting the server.  When a request is made to this server platform to start the server, it reads the configuration document and initializes the server with the appropriate services.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this hands-on lab you will learn about the contents of configuration documents.\n",
