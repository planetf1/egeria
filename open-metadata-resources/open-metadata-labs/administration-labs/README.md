# Administration Jupyter Notebooks

The administration notebooks define how to configure and manage Egeria OMAG servers
(such as metadata servers and governance servers) on the
[OMAG Server Platform](../../../open-metadata-publication/website/omag-server).

## Basic Setup

* [Understanding metadata server configuration](understanding-server-config.ipynb)
* [Starting and stopping servers](managing-servers.ipynb)

Once these notebooks are complete and the servers are running, you can choose to continue with this
page to learn more
about the platform and the other types of governance servers that is supports.

Alternatively you can jump straight to [building a data catalog](../asset-management-labs).

## Understanding more about the platform and metadata servers

* [Understanding more about the OMAG Server Platform](understanding-platform-services.ipynb)
* [Understanding the status of and open metadata cohort](understanding-cohorts.ipynb)

## Understanding about Egeria's governance servers

* [Configuring the discovery server](open-discovery-config.ipynb)


## What next?

If you have not tried it yet, we recommend the [building a data catalog](../asset-management-labs).
