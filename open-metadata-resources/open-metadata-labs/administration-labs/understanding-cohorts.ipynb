    "\n",
    "ODPi Egeria is an open source project that provides open standards and implementation libraries to connect tools,\n",
    "catalogs and platforms together so they can share information (called metadata) about data and the technology that supports it.\n",

    "The ODPi Egeria repository services provide APIs for understanding the make up of the cohorts that an OMAG Server\n",
    "is connected to. \n",

    "Gary Geeke is the IT Infrastructure leader at Coco Pharmaceuticals.  He has set up a number of OMAG Servers and\n",
