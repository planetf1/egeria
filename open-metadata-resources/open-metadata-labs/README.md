# Open Metadata Labs

The open metadata labs contain **Jupyter Notebooks** that allow you to try different capabilities of ODPi Egeria.

> (Not sure what Jupyter Notebooks are, or how to run them? Check out our [Beginner's Guide](../open-metadata-tutorials/beginners-guide).)

Each lab notebook describes a scenario from the
[Coco Pharmaceuticals](https://github.com/odpi/data-governance/tree/master/docs/coco-pharmaceuticals)
case study, focusing on a challenge that one or more of the personae face and
how they approached the solution.

The calls to the Egeria APIs necessary to complete the challenge are encoded in
the notebook so you can experiment with the APIs.  These labs can be used for individual study, as part of a class and / or
as the basis of a workbook for using Egeria within a specific organization.

## Running the Labs

There are three main ways to set up the software to run these labs.  These are listed below.
They each create exactly the same environment that supports the labs. 

The easiest option is listed first ....

* [Using Docker Compose](../open-metadata-tutorials/beginners-guide/running-docker-compose.md) to run them in a
self-contained environment on your own system.
* [Using Kubernetes](../open-metadata-tutorials/beginners-guide/running-kubernetes.md) to run them in a more
flexible, possibly public cloud self-contained environment.
* [Using your own local environment directly](../open-metadata-tutorials/beginners-guide/running-natively.md).

Once the software is in place, you then go to the `JupyterLab` browser window and begin with the
[read-me-first.ipynb](./read-me-first.ipynb) lab notebook to familiarize yourself with the tutorial tools. 
You can start running it by simply double-clicking the filename in the left pane of the Jupyter interface.

This notebook will guide you to the rest of the labs.
