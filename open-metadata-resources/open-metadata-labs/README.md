# Open Metadata Labs

The open metadata labs contains python notebooks
that allow you to try different aspects of the
ODPi Egeria capability.

Each notebook describes a scenario from the 
[Coco Pharmaceuticals](https://github.com/odpi/data-governance/tree/master/docs/coco-pharmaceuticals)
case study, describing
a challenge that one or more of the personas face and
how they approached the solution.

The calls to the Egeria APIs necessary
to complete the challenge are encoded in
the notebook so you can experiment with the
APIs.

The open metadata labs can be used for individual study,
as part of a class and/or as e basis of a workbook for
using Egeria within a specific organization.
