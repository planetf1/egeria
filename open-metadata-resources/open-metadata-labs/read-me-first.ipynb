    "### ODPi Egeria Hands-On Labs\n",
    "# Welcome to the Overview of the ODPi Egeria Hands-on Labs\n",
    "\n",
    "ODPi Egeria is an open source project that provides open standards and implementation libraries to connect tools, catalogs and platforms together so they can share information about data and technology (called metadata).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Egeria technology includes both libraries that can embedded into technologies that need to share metadata along with an integration platform called the **Open Metadata and Governance (OMAG) Platform** for hosting connectors, metadata servers and governance servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collectively the Egeria capabilities serve to integrate a diverse range of technologies to create a coherent view of an organization's IT assets and a consistent implementation of governance from the infrastructure, security, data, privacy and throughout the software development lifecycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **ODPi Egeria Hands-on Labs** provide a practical introduction to the Egeria technology.  They work through different scenarios using the personas from the fictitious company called **Coco Pharmaceuticals**.   Each lab introduces the characters involved and the work they are engaged in.  It defines the key Egeria concepts that you need to understand in order to follow along and then issues calls to Egeria to complete the work, providing explanations of the results received.  Bold text is used to emphasis concepts and elements of special note.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will notice that some of the concepts described include a hyperlink to more information. This extra information is not required to understand and follow along with the lab.  They are provided for your convenience if you want to follow up on a topic in more detail.   For example, if you wish to understand more about [Coco Pharamceuticals](https://opengovernance.odpi.org/coco-pharmaceuticals/), follow the link.\n",
    "\n",
    "The labs themselves are implemented using **Jupyter Notebooks**.  These are workspaces that can display text and images (like this section) as well as run code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using the Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "This introduction is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook.  Notice along the top there are a number of buttons like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Jupyter Controls](images/jupyter-notebook-play-button.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "One of them is a triangle.  This is the **play** button needed to step through the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Press the play button and notice that the left-hand border has changed."

  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Now the blue line is here.  Each time you press the play button, the notebook advances to the next \"cell\".  Some cells have descriptions in them and some are code fragments.  When you play a cell with code in it, the code runs.  Often this is to issue a call to an Egeria server.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the code can be complex.  However it is surrounded with explanations so it is not a problem if you are not a software developer.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is about all you need to know about the Jupyter Notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Starting up the Egeria platforms\n",
    "\n",
    "Egeria's hands-on labs assume that there are three OMAG Server Platforms running, along with Apache Zookeeper and Apache Kafka.   Click the play button again to run the code below.  This will check if the platforms are running."

To make it easy for you to learn about the parts of Egeria that interests you, the labs are divided into topics focused around different personas at Coco Pharmaceuticals.\n",
    "\n",
    "The different topics are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Administration Labs** - follow Gary Geeke (IT Infrastructure Lead) as he demonstrates how to manage the Egeria platforms and servers.\n",
    "* **Asset Management Labs** - follow Peter Profile (Information Analyst) and Erin Overview (Information Architect) as they build and maintain a catalog of Coco Pharmaceutical's assets.  Other colleagues, such as Callie Quartile (Data Scientist), then use the catalog to locate and use the assets they need.\n",
    "* **Conformance Testing Labs** - follow Polly Tasker as she runs Egeria's conformance test suite to ensure a metadata server conforms to the Egeria open metadata protocols.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sections that follow provide more information on these labs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Administration Labs\n",
    "\n",
    "Coco Pharmaceuticals is going through a major business transformation that requires them to drastically reduce their cycle times, collaborate laterally across the different parts of the business and react quickly to the changing needs of their customers. (See [this link](https://opengovernance.odpi.org/coco-pharmaceuticals/) for the background to this transformation).\n",
    "\n",
    "Part of the changes needed to the IT systems that support the business is the roll out of a distributed metadata and governance capability that is provided by ODPi Egeria.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Gary Geeke](https://opengovernance.odpi.org/coco-pharmaceuticals/personas/gary-geeke.html) is the IT Infrastructure leader at Coco Pharmaceuticals.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Gary Geeke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/odpi/data-governance/master/docs/coco-pharmaceuticals/personas/gary-geeke.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We first meet Gary in the labs to configure and start the Egeria OMAG servers.  In the administration\n",
    "labs, Gary is exploring the OMAG Server Platform and the servers' configuration and operation in more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "The administration labs (under **administration-labs**) include the following activities:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Managing Servers (managing-servers.ipynb)** covers how to start, restart and stop servers on the OMAG Server Platforms.\n",
    "* **Understanding Server Configuration (understanding-server-config.ipynb)** takes a deeper look that the contents of a **Configuration Document** that controls which services are activated in an Egeria server.\n",
    "* **Understanding Platform Services (understanding-platform-services.ipynb)** shows the commands to query the servers running on a platform plus other platform services.\n",
    "* **Understanding Cohorts (understanding-cohorts.ipynb)** shows how to query a server to discover the open metadata repository cohorts that it is connected to and the other servers in that cohort.\n",
    "* **Open Discovery Configuration (open-discovery-config.ipynb)** shows how to set up and configure a discovery server.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Asset Management Labs\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of the wide-spread business transformation that Coco Pharmaceuticals has embarked on, they\n",
    "have created a data lake for managing data for research, analytics, exchange between their internal organizations and business partners (such as hospitals).  As a result, the data lake has to be\n",
    "designed to handle a wide variety of data, including some highly sensitive and regulated data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the asset management labs (under **asset-managgement-labs** we look at how different roles work with the data lake and how Egeria's open metadata is captured, maintained and used.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first lab called **Building a data catalog (building-a-data-catalog.ipynb)** explains how data is cataloged and used in the data lake.  The two main character engaged in the first part of this lab are\n",
    "[Peter Profile](https://opengovernance.odpi.org/coco-pharmaceuticals/personas/peter-profile.html) and\n",

    "\n",
    "![Peter and Erin](images/peter-and-erin.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we show how visibility to the catalog is controlled through **governance zones**.\n",
    "This involves [Callie Quartile](https://opengovernance.odpi.org/coco-pharmaceuticals/personas/callie-quartile.html), a data scientist, who is keen to get access to the data that Peter and Erin are cataloging.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Callie Quartile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/odpi/data-governance/master/docs/coco-pharmaceuticals/personas/callie-quartile.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "She is unable to see the data until Peter and Erin have completed setting up the catalog entries for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once Callie does have access to the data, the second of the asset management labs shows how to use the metadata from the catalog.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Conformance Testing Labs\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last labs, we show how to run the conformance test suite against different technologies.\n"
