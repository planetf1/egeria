# Downloading and Building ODPi Egeria Tutorial

ODPi Egeria is an open source project that is delivered both as source code as well as
[Maven Central Repository](https://search.maven.org/) libraries.

This tutorial will guide you through the process of downloading the ODPi Egeria source
code from [GitHub](https://github.com/) and building it so that you can run it
on your local machine.
