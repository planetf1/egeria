# Downloading and Building ODPi Egeria Tutorial

ODPi Egeria is a an open source project that is delivered both as source code as well as 
[Maven Central Repository](https://search.maven.org/) libraries.

This tutorial will guide you through the process of downloading the ODPi Egeria source
code from [GitHub](https://github.com/) and building it so that you can run it
on your local machine.

## Prerequisite tasks

* Ensure you have a Java compiler at Version 8 (Update 151) or above installed on your machine.
Check the version of Java you have with the command **java -version**
(You can download Java from [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) and select **OpenJDK 8 (LTS)**
and the **HotSpot** version for your operating system.  You need the JDK rather than the JRE.)
* Ensure you have [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) 3.5.0 or above installed.
This is used to orchestrate the ODPi Egeria build.
* Ensure you have **git** installed.  On MacOS, this is part of the **Xcode** suite.
For other operating systems there are [various choices](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
