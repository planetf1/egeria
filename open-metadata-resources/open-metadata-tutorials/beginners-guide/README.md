# Beginner's Guide

If you are entirely new to technologies like Git, Java, Maven, Kafka, ZooKeeper, Jupyter, Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, etc
this guide is intended to give you a very brief introduction to the technologies involved in Egeria.

The technologies involved fit into these categories:

1. [Components for running Egeria in a self-contained environment using docker-compose](running-docker-compose.md).
1. [Components for running Egeria in a self-contained environment using Kubernetes](running-kubernetes.md).
1. [Components for running the Egeria natively](running-natively.md).
1. [Components for building and developing the Egeria software](building.md).

If you only want to get up and running with Egeria to follow along our tutorials as quickly as possible, you can simply
run through (1) or (2) which avoids the need to configure egeria and associated components locally..

If you are interested in understanding more about the underlying technologies, the remaining links provide progressively
more detail about each of the underlying technologies used by both the tutorials and by Egeria itself.
