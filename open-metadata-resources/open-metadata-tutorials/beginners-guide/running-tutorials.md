# Running the tutorials

The following technologies are used for running the Egeria tutorials.

In addition to these tutorial-specific components, you will need to run Egeria itself either:

- [using a self-contained environment that runs on top of your system](running-self-contained.md)
- [natively (directly) on your own system](running-natively.md)

## Jupyter

[Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) provides tools for interactive computing. In particular, we use
Jupyter Notebooks to provide an interactive tutorial that shows rich instructions, allows you to run
code, and to see the output all in the same interface.

Jupyter can be installed through Python mechanisms like [pip or as part of Anaconda](https://jupyter.org/install.html).
(If these are unknown to you, consider running the tutorials [using a self-contained environment](running-self-contained.md).)
