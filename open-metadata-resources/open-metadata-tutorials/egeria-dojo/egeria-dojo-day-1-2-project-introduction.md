It will also describe the software to download in preparation for
the next session.

## GitHub repositories

[GitHub](https://github.com) is a public service for managing files - particularly files associated
with a software project.  Many open source projects use GitHub and egeria is no exception.

All of the content for the Egeria project is stored in git repositories.
For example, these web pages you are reading as part of the dojo are
managed in Egeria's main git repository.

## Other resources

The Egeria community love to collaborate on the work they do.  Git and GitHub is
an excellent way to exchange and manage files.  In addition, the community
runs public calls that anyone can join, as well as a number of slack channels.

Details of the different ways the community operates is described in our
[Community Guide](../../../Community-Guide.md).  Click on the link to the community guide
to find out more.

## Test yourself

* Name three of the git repositories owned by the Egeria Project
  and describe what they do.
  
* Describe why the Egeria project is called "egeria".

* Log on to the ODPi slack service and post a message to the  `#egeria-dojo-live`
 channel to say that you have got this far in the dojo.

## Downloads for next session

It is time for a break now. However, if you want to save time,
the next session makes use of Docker containers to run Egeria.

If you do not have the docker desktop on your machine,
you can link to [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/why-docker) and download and install
the **Docker Desktop**.

Once these are downloading you can take a break.
