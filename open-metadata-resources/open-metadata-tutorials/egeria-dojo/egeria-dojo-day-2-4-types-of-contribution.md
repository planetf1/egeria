# Running Egeria on your machine - Step-by-Step

In this session, you will learn about the different types of contribution and how much knowledge of
Egeria is required to complete one.

The diagram below shows the different types of contribution.  We have used the
same color scheme as the dojo sessions to give you a view on how hard each one is.
