# OMAG Server Platform Tutorial

The [Open Metadata and Governance (OMAG) Server Platform](../../../open-metadata-publication/website/omag-server)
is a flexible server platform that
can run many different types of open metadata and governance services.

## Objectives

At the end of this tutorial you will be able to perform the following tasks.

* Starting the OMAG Server Platform
* Using the Administration Services to:
  * Configure open metadata and governance services in "logical servers".
  * Start up the configured services.
  * Make calls to the running services.
  * Shutdown running services.
  * Remove the configuration for open metadata and governance services.
  
## Prerequisite Tasks

* [Download and build ODPi Egeria](../building-egeria-tutorial)
* [Familiarize yourself with the Postman test tool](task-working-with-postman.md)

## Tutorial Tasks

1. [Starting the OMAG Server Platform](task-starting-the-omag-server-platform.md)
2. [Creating Configuration Documents](task-creating-configuration-documents.md)
3. [Activating Logical OMAG Servers in the OMAG Server Platform](task-starting-omag-server.md)
