# Virtual Data Connector Demo
  
The virtual data connector demo contains the resources
necessary to run the VDC demo.

This demo shows metadata exchange between two open metadata repositories and the use of this
metadata to configure a data virtualization platform with views and a security tool to provide
metadata driven access control for the data virtualization platform.
