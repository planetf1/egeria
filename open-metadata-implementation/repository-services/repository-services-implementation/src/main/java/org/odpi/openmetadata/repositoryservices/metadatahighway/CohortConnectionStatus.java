/**
 * CohortConnectionStatus defines the status of the local server's connection to the metadata highway for
 * a specific cohort.
 * <ul>
 *     <li>
 *         NOT_INITIALIZED - the local components for communicating with other members of the cohort are not initialized.
 *         This should never been seen on the adminservices console since it is the value for the cohort manager used on the
 *         variable declaration.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         INITIALIZING - the local components for communicating with the other members of the cohort are initializing.
 *         It the server is working properly this status is only set for a split-second.
 *         If it is seen on the adminservices console it probably means one of the underlying connectors is hanging during its
 *         initialization.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         NEW - the local components for the cohort are initialized but they have not yet exchanged messages with the other
 *         members of the cohort.  At this point, the local metadata collection id may be changed.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         CONFIGURATION_ERROR - means there is an error in the configuration and connection is not possible.
 *         The administrator needs to either fix the config or fix the system's infrastructure around the server.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         CONNECTED - means the server is connected to the metadata highway for this cohort and is exchanging messages.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         DISCONNECTING - means the server is disconnecting from the metadata highway and is in the process of shutting
 *         down the local components that manage communication with the other members of this cohort.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         DISCONNECTED - means the server is disconnected from the metadata highway for this cohort.  This may be because the
 *         local server is shutting down or the configuration is being adjusted.
 *     </li>
