# Repository services clients

This module supports two clients to the Open Metadata Repository Services (OMRS).

* Local Repository Services Client - calls to the local repository in a remote
server.  This client is used in the OMRSRESTRepositoryConnector
used to call remote servers during federated queries.

* Enterprise Repository Services Client - calls to the enterprise repository services
in a remote server.
