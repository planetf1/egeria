# Enterprise Metadata Collection

The enterprise metadata collection is the [metadata collection](metadata-collection.md)
that is the combination of metadata from all of the metadata collections held by the
[open metadata repositories](open-metadata-repository.md) that are members of
the same [open metadata repository cohorts](open-metadata-repository-cohort.md)
as the server where the
[enterprise repository services](subsystem-descriptions/enterprise-repository-services.md) are enabled.
