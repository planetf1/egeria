# Open Metadata Type Definitions (TypeDefs)

TypeDefs define the characteristics of a particular type of an [open metadata instance](open-metadata-instances.md)
There are three categories of TypeDefs (`TypeDefCategory`):

* **EntityDef**: the definition of a type of [entity](open-metadata-instances.md)
* **RelationshipDef**: the definition of a type of [relationship](open-metadata-instances.md)
* **ClassificationDef**: the definition of a type of [classification](open-metadata-instances.md)

TypeDefs can inherit from other TypeDefs from the same category.  Open metadata support single inheritance.

TypeDefs also define then names and types of properties for a metadata instance of that type.
Each property has a **TypeDefAttribute** definition that references an **AttributeTypeDef**
as its type.

The AttributeTypeDefs are the type definitions for properties.
There are three categories of AttributeTypeDefs.

* **EnumDef**: the definition of an enumerated list of valid values.
* **CollectionDef**: the definition of a collection - such as an array of strings, or a map from string to object.
* **PrimitiveDef**: a primitive - such as a string, integer or date.
