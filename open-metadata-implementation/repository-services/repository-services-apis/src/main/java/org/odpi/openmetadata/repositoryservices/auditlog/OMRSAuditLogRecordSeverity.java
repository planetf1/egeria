 * OMRSAuditLogRecordSeverity defines the different levels of severity for log records stored in the OMRSAuditLogRecord.
 * <ul>
 *     <li>
 *         UNKNOWN - Uninitialized Severity - if this is seen then there is a logic error in the audit log processing.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         INFO - An activity occurred as part of the normal operation of the open metadata repository.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         EVENT - An OMRS Event was sent to or received from members of an open metadata repository cohort.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         DECISION - A decision has been made related to the interaction of the local metadata repository and the
 *         rest of the open metadata repository cohort.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         ACTION - A situation has been detected that requires administrator intervention.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         ERROR - An unexpected error occurred, possibly caused by an incompatibility between the local metadata repository
 *         and one of the remote repositories.  The local repository may restrict some of the metadata interchange
 *         functions as a result.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         Exception Unexpected exception occurred.  This means that the local repository needs some administration
 *         attention to correct configuration or fix a logic error because it is not operating as a proper peer in the
 *         metadata repository cluster.
 *     </li>
