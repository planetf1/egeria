/**
 * OMRSRegistryEventType defines the different types of registry events in the open metadata repository services
 * protocol.  There are 4 basic values.
 * <ul>
 *     <li>
 *         UNKNOWN_REGISTRY_EVENT - the event is not recognized by this local server, probably because it is back-level
 *         from other servers in the cohort.  It is logged in the audit log and then ignored.  The registration
 *         protocol should evolve so that new message types can be ignored by back-level servers without damage
 *         to the cohort's integrity.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         REGISTRATION_EVENT - this event is a server's first contact with the cohort.  It publicises the id of the
 *         local repository, the connection information needed to connect remotely to this local server's
 *         repository (localServerRemoteConnection) plus a list of typedef names and GUIDs.  Other servers in the
 *         cohort will respond either with a RE_REGISTRATION_EVENT if all is ok or REGISTRATION_ERROR if there
 *         is a problem with any information in the REGISTRATION_EVENT.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         REFRESH_REGISTRATION_EVENT - this event is used after a local server has experienced configuration issues
 *         and needs to receive the registration information from other members of the cohort again.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         RE_REGISTRATION_EVENT - this event is used by a previously registered server to broadcast its current
 *         configuration.  It is used in response to a REGISTRATION_EVENT and a REFRESH_REGISTRATION_EVENT to
 *         let the other servers know about its configuration, or whenever its configuration may have changed
 *         (such as after a server restart or administrator action).
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         UN_REGISTRATION_EVENT - this event is used when a server is being removed from the cohort.  The other
 *         servers can choose whether to remove its replicated metadata from their repository, or mark it as
 *         deregistered repository's metadata.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         REGISTRATION_ERROR_EVENT - ths event is used to report anomalies in the registration information being
 *         passed between the repositories and the actions taken.  Each of these errors should be investigated
 *         since they should not occur.
 *     </li>
 * </ul>
