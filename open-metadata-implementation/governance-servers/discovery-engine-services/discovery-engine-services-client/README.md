# Discovery Engine Services Client

The discovery engine client module contains the client
implementation of the calls to the discovery engine
that request that a particular
[open discovery service](../../../frameworks/open-discovery-framework/docs/discovery-service.md)
is run against an Asset.

It also supports the ability to query the status of a discovery request and
retrieve the discovery analysis report for the discovery service request.
