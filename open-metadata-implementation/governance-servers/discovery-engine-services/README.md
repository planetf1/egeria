# Discovery Engine Services

The discovery engine services provide the core subsystem for a
[discovery server](../../admin-services/docs/concepts/discovery-server.md).
A discovery server is an [OMAG Server](../../admin-services/docs/concepts/omag-server.md)
that hosts [automated metadata discovery](../../../open-metadata-publication/website/metadata-discovery).

The discovery engine services subsystem is capable of hosting one or more
[discovery engines](../../frameworks/open-discovery-framework/docs/discovery-engine.md)
and supports a REST API to request that a discovery engine runs an
[discovery service](../../frameworks/open-discovery-framework/docs/discovery-service.md)
to analyse an [asset](../../access-services/docs/concepts/assets) and to access the results.

The REST API also supports a request to a discovery engine to run a specific open discovery service
against each asset it has access to.

The discovery engine services call the
[Discovery Engine Open Metadata Access Service (OMAS)](../../access-services/discovery-engine)
running in an open metadata server to retrieve information about assets and to
store the results of the discovery services.

## Open Discovery Framework (ODF)

The terminology associated with the discovery engine services comes from the
[Open Discovery Framework (ODF)](../../frameworks/open-discovery-framework/docs).
This framework provides the interface
definitions for the discovery services
and the APIs that support them.

An open discovery service is a specialized component from the
[Open Discovery Framework (ODF)](../../frameworks/open-discovery-framework/docs).
It provides analysis of the properties of a supplied asset in the form of
[Annotations](../../frameworks/open-discovery-framework/docs/discovery-annotation.md)

The discovery engine is initialized with information about the
[Discovery Engine OMAS](../../access-services/discovery-engine) it should connect with to
retrieve information about the discovery services and to record their results.

The discovery engine provides a REST API to request that a specific discovery service is run for an asset, or
that all applicable discovery services are run for the asset.

The results of each of these
calls is a [discovery analysis report](../../frameworks/open-discovery-framework/docs/discovery-analysis-report.md).

The discovery engine calls the Discovery Engine OMAS to retrieve information about the Asset's supported discovery
services and to attach the discovery analysis report to the Asset.
