/**
 * <p>
 * The Connector is the interface for all connector instances.   Connectors are client-side interfaces to assets
 * such as data stores, data sets, APIs, analytical functions.  They handle the communication with the server that
 * hosts the assets, along with the communication with the metadata server to serve up metadata (properties) about
 * the assets.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Each connector implementation is paired with a connector provider.  The connector provider is the factory for
 * connector instances.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The Connector interface defines that a connector instance should be able to return a unique
 * identifier, a connection object and a metadata object called ConnectedAssetProperties.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Each specific implementation of a connector then extends the Connector interface to add the methods to work with the
 * particular type of asset it supports.  For example, a JDBC connector would add the standard JDBC SQL interface, the
 * OMRS Connectors add the metadata repository management APIs...
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The initialize() method is called by the Connector Provider to set up the connector instance Id and the
 * Connection properties for the connector as part of its construction process.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * ConnectedAssetProperties provides descriptive properties about the asset that the connector is accessing.
 * It is supplied to the connector later during its initialization through the initializeConnectedAssetProperties() method.
 * See AssetConsumer OMAS for an example of this.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Both the connector and the connector provider have base classes (ConnectorBase and
 * ConnectorProviderBase respectively) that implement all of the standard methods.  The connector developer extends
 * these classes to add the specific methods to manage the asset and configure the base classes.
 * </p>
