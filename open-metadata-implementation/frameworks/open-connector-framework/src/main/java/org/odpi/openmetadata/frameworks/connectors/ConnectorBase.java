/**
 * The ConnectorBase is an implementation of the Connector interface.
 *
 * Connectors are client-side interfaces to assets such as data stores, data sets, APIs, analytical functions.
 * They handle the communication with the server that hosts the assets, along with the communication with the
 * metadata server to serve up metadata about the assets, and support for an audit log for the caller to log its
 * activity.
 *
 * Each connector implementation is paired with a connector provider.  The connector provider is the factory for
 * connector instances.
 *
 * The Connector interface defines that a connector instance should be able to return a unique
 * identifier, a connection object and a metadata properties object for its connected asset.
 * These are supplied to the connector during its initialization.
 *
 * The ConnectorBase base class implements all of the methods required by the Connector interface.
 * Each specific implementation of a connector then extends this interface to add the methods to work with the
 * particular type of asset it supports.  For example, a JDBC connector would add the standard JDBC SQL interface, the
 * OMRS Connectors add the metadata repository management APIs...
