# Discovery Analysis Report

The discovery analysis report lists the [discovery annotations](discovery-annotation.md)
that were created during the execution of
a [discovery service](discovery-service.md).

The discovery analysis report is created in the open metadata repository
by the [discovery engine](discovery-engine.md) when it creates the
discovery service instance.
The discovery service can retrieve information about the discovery analysis report
through the [discovery analysis report store](discovery-analysis-report-store.md) client.

This client is accessed
through the [discovery annotation store](discovery-annotation-store.md).

The discovery analysis report store also enables a long running discovery service
(typically a [discovery pipeline](discovery-pipeline.md)) to record its current
analysis step.
