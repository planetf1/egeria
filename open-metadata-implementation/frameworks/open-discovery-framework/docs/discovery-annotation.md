# Discovery Annotations

A discovery annotation describes one or more related properties about an
[Asset](../../../../open-metadata-implementation/access-services/docs/concepts/assetss) that has been
discovered by a [discovery service](discovery-service.md).

Some discovery annotations refer to an entire asset and others refer to a data field within
an asset.   The annotations that describe a data field are called **data field annotations**.



## Open Metadata Types for Discovery Annotations

The open metadata types for a discovery annotations are describe in
[Area 6](../../../../open-metadata-publication/website/open-metadata-types/Area-6-models.md).

The main entity type is called
[Annotation](../../../../open-metadata-publication/website/open-metadata-types/0610-Annotations.md).
It is extended by
[DataFieldAnnotation](../../../../open-metadata-publication/website/open-metadata-types/0617-DataFieldAnalysis.md)
to distinguish annotations that refer, primarily to a data field.
