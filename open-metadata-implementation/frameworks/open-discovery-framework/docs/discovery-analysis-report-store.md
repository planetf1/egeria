# Discovery Analysis Report Store

The discovery analysis report store is a client to an open metadata server that enables
a [discovery service](discovery-service.md) to query the properties of its
[discovery analysis report](discovery-analysis-report.md) and update the analysis step that is currently executing.

The discovery analysis report store is accessed
from the [discovery annotation store](discovery-annotation-store.md).
