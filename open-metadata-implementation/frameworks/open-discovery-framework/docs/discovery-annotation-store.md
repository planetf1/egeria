# Discovery Annotation Store

The discovery annotation store provides
a [discovery-service](discovery-service.md)
with a client to write [discovery annotations](discovery-annotation.md) to an open
metadata repository.  These annotations describe the
results of the analysis performed on an asset by the
discovery service.

The annotations are linked to a [discovery analysis report](discovery-analysis-report.md)
that is in turn linked off of the analysed asset.

The discovery service is passed
the discovery annotation store via the
[discovery context](discovery-context.md).
