# Discovery Request Type

The discovery request type, as the name suggests, is the
name of the type of discovery that a
[discovery engine](discovery-engine.md) should run.
It is a string value and is defined in the
[discovery configuration server](discovery-configuration-server.md).

Each discovery request type is associated with a
[discovery service](discovery-service.md).
When a discovery request is made the discovery engine,
it looks up the discovery request type and runs the
associated discovery service.
