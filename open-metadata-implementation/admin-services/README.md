# Administration Services

The administration services support the configuration of the open metadata and governance services
within the [OMAG Server Platform](docs/concepts/omag-server-platform.md)
This configuration determines which of the open metadata and governance services are active.

It also supports the starting and stopping of logical [OMAG Servers](docs/concepts/logical-omag-server.md)
on the OMAG server platform and querying the runtime (operational) state of these servers.
