# Configuring the Open Metadata Access Services (OMASs)

The [Open Metadata Access Services (OMASs)](../../../access-services) provide the domain-specific
APIs for metadata management and governance.

#### Enable the access services

To enable the access services (and the enterprise
repository services that support them) use the following command.

```
POST http://localhost:8080/open-metadata/admin-services/users/garygeeke/servers/cocoMDS1/access-services
```

#### Disable the access services


The access services can be disabled with the following command.
This also disables the enterprise repository services since they
are not being used.

```
DELETE http://localhost:8080/open-metadata/admin-services/users/garygeeke/servers/cocoMDS1/access-services
```
