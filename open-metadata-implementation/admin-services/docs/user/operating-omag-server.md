# Activating and deactivating the OMAG server

Once a [configuration document](../concepts/configuration-document.md) has been completed
for an [OMAG Server](../concepts/omag-server.md), it can be started using the following
REST call:

```
POST http://localhost:8080/open-metadata/admin-services/users/garygeeke/servers/cocoMDS1/instance
```

and stopped, as follows:

```
DELETE http://localhost:8080/open-metadata/admin-services/users/garygeeke/servers/cocoMDS1/instance
```

The configuration document is not changed by these calls.
It is possible to query the running server's configuration using the following REST API:

```
GET http://localhost:8080/open-metadata/admin-services/users/garygeeke/servers/cocoMDS1/instance/configuration
```

If you want to delete the server's configuration document then issue:

```
DELETE http://localhost:8080/open-metadata/admin-services/users/garygeeke/servers/cocoMDS1
```

If the OMAG server is running, this command also unregisters the named server from the cohorts it
is connected to.
Only use this command if the server is being permanently removed.
