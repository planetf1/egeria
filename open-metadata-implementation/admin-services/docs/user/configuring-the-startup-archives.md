# Configuring the Open Metadata Archives that are loaded on Server Startup

An open metadata archive is a store of read-only metadata types and instances.
One or more open metadata archives can be configured to load at the start up of the
following types of [OMAG Servers](../concepts/omag-server.md).

* [Metadata Access Point](../concepts/metadata-access-point.md)
* [Metadata Server](../concepts/metadata-server.md)
* [Repository Proxy](../concepts/repository-proxy.md)


Typically open metadata archives are stored as files.  To configure the load of a file
use the following command.  The file should be specified either as a fully qualified path name
or as a path name relative to the start up directory of the OMAG Server Platform.

```
POST {serverURLRoot}/open-metadata/admin-services/users/{adminUserId}/servers/{serverName}/open-metadata-archives/file
{ path name of file }
```

Alternatively it is possible to set up the list of open metadata archives as a list of
[Connections](../../../frameworks/open-connector-framework/docs/concepts/connection.md).
These connections refer to connectors that can read and retrieve the open metadata archive content.
```
POST {serverURLRoot}/open-metadata/admin-services/users/{adminUserID}/servers/serverName/open-metadata-archives
{ list of connections }
```
This option can be used when the open metadata archives are not stored in a file, or a different
file connector from the default one for the OMAG Server Platform is required.

Finally this is how to remove the archives from the configuration document.

```
DELETE {serverURLRoot}/open-metadata/admin-services/users/{adminUserId}/servers/{serverName}/open-metadata-archives
{ path name of file }
```
