# View Server

A **View Server** is an [OMAG Server](omag-server.md)
that hosts the presentation services to support a UI.
These services are designed to support specific display paradigms needed
by different types of UIs.

Each view server hosts one or more **Open Metadata View Services (OMVSs)**.
A [view service](view-services.md) supports a collection of related presentation services
that support a particular part of a UI.  **Asset Search** is an example of a view
service.

The presentation server is hosting the JavaScript that controls the browser display.
