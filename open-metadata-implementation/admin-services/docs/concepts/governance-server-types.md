# Governance Server Types

Governance servers host specific integration or governance connectors for technology that does not integrate directly with open metadata.

* **Data Engine Proxy Server** - captures information about processes and the data sources that they work with and catalogs them in open metadata.
* **Data Platform Server** - captures information about assets on a data platform and catalogs them in open metadata.
* **[Discovery Server](discovery-server.md)** - runs the discovery services to extract descriptive information from Assets and stores it in open metadata.
* **Security Officer Server** - sets up security definitions.
* **Security Sync Server** - automatically configures security verification endpoints such as Apache Ranger based on open metadata values.
* **Stewardship Server** - automates the management of assets.
* **Open Lineage Server** - accumulates lineage information to provide a comprehensive historical reporting service for lineage.
* **Virtualizer Server** - automatically configures a data virtualization engine based on the available assets.
