# Open Metadata and Governance (OMAG) Server

An **OMAG server** is a software server that
runs inside the [OMAG server platform](omag-server-platform.md).

It is started up and shut down using administration commands.
The start up command (called **initialize**) passes a
[configuration document](configuration-document.md) to
the OMAG Server Platform.
This configuration document defines the type of OMAG server
that is to be started, and how the services within it are configured.

The shutdown command (called **terminate**) performs an orderly shutdown
of the services within the server and disables its URL.

There is more information on the OMAG Server and its relationship to
the OMAG Server Platform [here](../../../../open-metadata-publication/website/omag-server).
