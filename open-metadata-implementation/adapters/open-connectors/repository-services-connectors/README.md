# Repository Services Connectors

The repository-services-connectors contains connector implementations for
each type of connector supported by the Open Metadata Repository Services (OMRS).
These connectors enable the OMRS to be adapted to many different platforms.

* **audit-log-connectors** supports different destinations for 
audit log messages.

* **cohort-registry-store-connectors** contains connectors the store of
cohort membership details used and maintained by the cohort registry.
There is a cohort registry (and hence a cohort registry store)
for each open metadata repository server.

* **open-metadata-archive-connectors** contains connectors that can
read and write open metadata archives.

* **open-metadata-repository-connectors** contains connectors that
support mappings to different vendor's metadata repositories.

* **open-metadata-topic-connectors** contains connectors that support
the OMRS Topic used for asynchronous event passing between members of
an open metadata repository cohort.

In addition, the **repository-services-configuration-factory** sets
up connections to the default implementations
of each type of the repository services connectors.
