# Open Metadata Collection Store Connector Documentation

* **[Overview of the Repository Connector Interface](overview-of-the-repository-connector-interface.md)** -
a walk-through of the methods on the repository connector interface.  This connector enables
the Open Metadata Repository Services (OMRS) the ability to search, query, create, update and delete
metadata in an existing metadata repository.

* **[Overview of the Event Mapper Connector Interface](overview-of-the-event-mapper-connector-interface.md)** -
a walk-through of the methods on the event mapper connector interface.  This connector enables
events from an existing metadata repository that indicate that metadata is changing, to be passed
to the OMRS so it can be distributed to the other metadata repositories who are members of the same cohort.
