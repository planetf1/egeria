/**
 * The GraphOMRSErrorCode is used to define first failure data capture (FFDC) for errors that occur within the OMRS
 * It is used in conjunction with all OMRS Exceptions, both Checked and Runtime (unchecked).
 *
 * The 5 fields in the enum are:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>HTTP Error Code for translating between REST and JAVA. Typically the numbers used are:</li>
 *     <li><ul>
 *         <li>500: internal error</li>
 *         <li>501: not implemented </li>
 *         <li>503: Service not available</li>
 *         <li>400: invalid parameters</li>
 *         <li>401: unauthorized</li>
 *         <li>404: not found</li>
 *         <li>405: method not allowed</li>
 *         <li>409: data conflict errors, for example an item is already defined</li>
 *     </ul></li>
 *     <li>Error Message Id: to uniquely identify the message</li>
 *     <li>Error Message Text: includes placeholder to allow additional values to be captured</li>
 *     <li>SystemAction: describes the result of the error</li>
 *     <li>UserAction: describes how a user should correct the error</li>
 * </ul>
