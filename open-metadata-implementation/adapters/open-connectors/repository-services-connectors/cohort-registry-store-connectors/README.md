# Cohort Registry Store Connectors

The cohort registry store connectors are connectors that store the
cohort membership details used and maintained by the cohort registry.
There is a cohort registry (and hence a cohort registry store)
for each open metadata repository server.

* **cohort-registry-file-store** - provides the means to store
the cohort registry membership details as a JSON file.
