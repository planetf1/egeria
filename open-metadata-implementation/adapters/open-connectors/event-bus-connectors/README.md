# Event Bus Connectors

Event bus connectors support different event/messaging infrastructures.
They can be plugged into the topic connectors from the access-service-connectors
and repository-service-connectors.

* **[open-metadata-topic-connectors](open-metadata-topic-connectors)** support
the base Open Metadata Topic used for asynchronous event passing between members of
the open metadata ecosystem.
