# Event Bus Connectors

Event bus connectors support different event/messaging infrastructures.
They can be plugged into the topic connectors from the access-service-connectors
and repository-service-connectors.

* **kafka-open-connector** implements a Kafka connector for a topic that exchanges
Java Objects as JSON payloads.
