# Governance Daemon Connectors

The governance daemon connectors contain connectors for the governance
daemon servers that monitor activity or synchronize metadata and configuration
asynchronously between different tools.

* **[security-sync-connectors](security-sync-connectors)** provide plugins to the governance daemon
that synchronize classification, user information and governance definitions
with security enforcement points.

* **[view-generator-connectors](view-generator-connectors)** provide plugins to the governance daemon
that automatically configure data virtualization platforms from
open metadata.
