# Glossary Author
This folder includes design artifacts created around the subject area UI in the UI chassis. 
After this time, we realised that the approach was glossary centric. So we renamed this approach

# Subject Area
A Subject Area approach would start from the Subject Area and probably would not be interested in the glossaries.
