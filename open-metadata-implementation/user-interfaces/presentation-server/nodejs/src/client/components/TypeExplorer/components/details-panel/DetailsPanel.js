/**
*
* DetailsPanel implements a web component for presentation of details of the focus or view type
*
* It should present to the user a summary of the key characteristics of the focus or view type. This includes:
*
*  For entity types:
*    * type name
*    * description
*    * attributes (listing names of types)
*    * relationships (listing attribute names and types and providing a link to the relationship details)
*    * classifications (listing attribute names and types and providing a link to the classification details)
*
*  For relationship types:
*    * type name
*    * description
*    * attributes (listing names of types)
*    * ends (listing entity types and providing a link to the entity details)
*
*  For classification types:
*
*    * type name
*    * description
*    * attributes (listing names of types)
*    * valid entity types (listing entity types and providing a link to the entity details)
*
* The details panel reacts to events that indicate a change of focus (an entity type's details should be shown)
* or a change of view (a relationship or classification details should be shown).
* Because the details panel also includes links to entity, relationship and classification types (as outlined above)
* the details panel also generates events requesting changeFocus or changeView.
*
* When the UI is first loaded there will be no type information, and until a focus or view type is selected there is
* no particular type to display - therefore following initial load and until a focus/view type is selected, the details
* panel will be blank.
*
