# User Interface (UI) Chassis

The UI chassis is the component that provides the base
server infrastructure for the
[UI Server Platform](../../open-metadata-publication/website/ui-server).

It is written using [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot).
and manages the REST APIs' endpoint.  Calls to the ui chassis result in rest calls
to appropriate Open Metadata or Goverance Services.

Since this is a Spring Boot application, it can be
[customized using the application.properties](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/common-application-properties.html)
file found in the `resources` directory and using environment variables.

The ui chassis code is here:
* **[ui-chassis-spring](ui-chassis-spring)** - ui chassis using Spring.
