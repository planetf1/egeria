# Open Metadata User Interfaces

Egeria provides basic user interfaces to demonstrate the power of the open
metadata and governance capabilities.  They are fully functional as
far as the standards go, and could be used by a small company.  However,
it is likely that commercial offering will offer a richer user experience,
particularly for a larger organization.

There are 2 user interfaces:

* access-services-user-interface - provides a user interface that supports
the user-facing open metadata access services.  It is a role-based UI that
offers different capabilities based on the end user's role.  This makes it
useful for demonstrations.

* server-configuration-user-interface - provides the administration user
interface for an open metadata server.
