# Repository Handler

The repository handler provides methods for managing linked groups
of Open Metadata Repository Services (OMRS) instances.

The Repository Handler also provides error handling that converts the exceptions from the OMRS into common services exceptions.
The aim is to reduce the coding needed in the specific handlers used by the Open Metadata Access Services (OMASs).
