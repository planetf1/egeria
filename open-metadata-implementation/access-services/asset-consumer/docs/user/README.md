## Asset Consumer OMAS User Guide

The Asset Consumer OMAS offers the following types of interface:

* [Java client](../../asset-consumer-client/docs/user/java-client), 
* [REST API](../../asset-consumer-client/docs/user) and 
* [topic](../../asset-consumer-client/docs/user/java-events) for receiving events about assets.

These interfaces are heavily influenced by the
[Open Connector Framework (OCF)](../../../../frameworks/open-connector-framework).
