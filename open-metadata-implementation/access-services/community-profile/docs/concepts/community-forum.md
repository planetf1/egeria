# Community Forum

A community forum provides a place for a [community](community.md) to store notes and comments
about a specific topic.  Forums can be
created by [community contributors, administrators and leaders](community-roles.md).

Each forum has a name, description and a list of
**forum contributions**.
 
Forum contributions can be created by community members, leaders and administrators.
Each contribution can be updated/deleted by the community administrators.

Anyone can add comments to a forum contribution.  Thus it is
possible for a forum contribution to simply pose a question to the membership
and the membership creates the discussion and possible answers using comments.
