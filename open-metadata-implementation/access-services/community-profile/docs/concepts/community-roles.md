# Community roles

[Members](community-member.md) of a [community](community.md) are assigned a role.
The roles are additive.

At a minimum, a members is a [Community Observer](community-observer.md).
This means they receive notifications from the community.

This can be upgraded to [Community Contributor](community-contributor.md)
to add the right to post content to the community.

Next is a [Community Administrator](community-administrator.md)
who is given the additional ability to add members and delete inappropriate content.

Finally the [Community Leader](community-leader.md) has all of the powers of
the administrator but really focuses on the health and content of the community - typically
creating forums, keeping the exchange of information flowing, ensuring the
lists of useful resources and external references are up to date, and more.


The person creating a community is the first community leader.
This can be changed.
Typically the community leader assigns administrators to manage the membership lists to free them up
to manage the content.
