# Peer Network

An individual can maintain a list of their close/important colleagues.
This is called their **peer network** and it is chained off of their
[personal profile](personal-profile.md).

It is important to note that the perspective on who is a
close/important colleague is a personal perspective.
Therefore Community Profile OMAS separates the concept of
who has linked to them from who they have linked to.
