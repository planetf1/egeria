# Comments

[Comments] are informal messages or feedback.  They can be attached to many places, for example
a [personal note](personal-notes.md),
a [community](community.md), 
a [community forum or community forum contribution](community-forum.md),
a [review](review.md),
an [external reference](external-reference.md),
or another comment.

Sometimes specific names are used for comments depending on what
they are attached to.  For example:
 * a **personal note comment** is a comment attached to a personal note.
 * a **forum comment** is a comment attached to a community forum either directly or via a community forum contribution.
 * a **comment reply** is a comment attached to another comment.  

The ability to reply to a comment (or a comment reply) means that comments can be chained
together to show a detailed conversation on a topic.

The owner of a personal profile or the administrator of a community
are able to remove inappropriate or out-of-date comments
attached to their personal profile or community respectively.
