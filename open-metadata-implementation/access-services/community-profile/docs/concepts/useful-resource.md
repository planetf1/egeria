# Useful Resources

A resource is definition that is used frequently and so it is helpful to have a link to it.
Examples of resources include glossaries, or categories and terms from a glossary,
governance definitions, models, system definitions or process definitions.

It is possible to maintain a list of useful resources for a
[personal profile](personal-profile.md), 
a [team](../../../docs/concepts/organizations/team.md) or a [community](community.md).
