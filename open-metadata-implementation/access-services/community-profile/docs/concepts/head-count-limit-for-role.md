# Head count limit

The head count limit is an optional value that can be set in a
[personal role](personal-roles.md).  This determines
how many people are funded for the role.

Open metadata does not prevent more people than this limit being
appointed to the role, but it does send a notification to indicate that
the limit has been breached.

The organization can choose to increase the head count limit or
remove one of the appointed people.
