# Community

A community is a anchor point for grouping people and resources together around a common interest.
Communities are typically long running endeavours.

Communities have [members](community-member.md).  These are the people working together in the
community.

The community can gather together a [list of useful resources](useful-resource.md)
and a list of [external references](external-reference.md).

The members can create [forums](community-forum.md) on different topics to share information.

The members can attach [comments](comment.md) to the community itself and to forum
contributions, and add replies to them.

Members can also provide [reviews](review.md) to forum contributions.  This includes a star rating and
review comment.

Members can add tags to the community and any of its contents.

Members can also add [a like](like.md) to the community and any of its contents.
