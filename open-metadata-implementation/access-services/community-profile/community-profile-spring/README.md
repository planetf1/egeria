# Community Profile Open Metadata Access Service (OMAS) with Spring

The Community Profile OMAS spring module uses [spring](../../../../developer-resources/Spring.md) to create the
server-side support for the REST services.   There are the following
spring resources defined:

* MyProfileResource - supports the services that manage the
personal profile of the requesting user.

* PersonalProfilesResource - supports the services that manage personal
profiles for people other than the requesting user.

* TeamsResource - supports the services that manage teams and their relationships
to each other and the people who are members.

* CommunitiesResource - supports the services that administer the
Egeria communities.
