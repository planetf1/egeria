# NoProfileForUserException

The NoProfileForUserException is returned on an API that
is working either directly with a personal profile, or
objects that are linked from the personal profile,
and there is no personal profile for the requested user
in the open metadata repositories.

The exception returns the userId that does not have a profile.
