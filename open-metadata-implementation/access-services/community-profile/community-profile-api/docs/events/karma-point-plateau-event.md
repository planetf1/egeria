# Karma Point Plateau Event

A Karma Point Plateau Event is sent each time a person achieves a
[karma point plateau](../../../docs/concepts/karma-point-plateau.md).

The event includes information about the person receiving the karma point plateau, the number of karma points
they have been awarded in total and the setting of the karma point plateau threshold.
