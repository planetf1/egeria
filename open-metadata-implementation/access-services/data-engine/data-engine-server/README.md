  * interaction with the [administration services](../../../admin-services) for
    registration, configuration, initialization and termination of the access service.
  * interaction with the [repository services](../../../repository-services) to work with open metadata from the
    [cohort](../../../repository-services/docs/open-metadata-repository-cohort.md).
  * support for the access service's API and its related event management.
