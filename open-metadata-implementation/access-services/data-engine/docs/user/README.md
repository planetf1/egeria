# Data Engine OMAS User Documentation


The Data Engine OMAS manages the creation of open metadata types for all the assets and jobs that are involved in ETL transformation.

Data Engine OMAS offers a [Java client](../../data-engine-client/docs/user/java-client) and
[REST API](../../data-engine-client/docs/user) for creating the job metadata.
