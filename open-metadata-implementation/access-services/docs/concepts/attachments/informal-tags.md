# Informal tags

An informal tag is a descriptive label that has a name with optional
description.  It can be attached to [resources](../resource.md) such as
[assets](../assets),
[personal profiles](../../../community-profile/docs/concepts/personal-profile.md),
[personal messages](../../../community-profile/docs/concepts/personal-message.md),
[personal notes](../../../community-profile/docs/concepts/personal-notes.md),
[community forums](../../../community-profile/docs/concepts/community-forum.md) and forum contributions,
[comments](../feedback/comments.md) and [communities](../../../community-profile/docs/concepts/community.md)
in order to make them easy to find.

An informal tag can be public (visible to all users) or
private (visible only to the user that created it).

It is possible to have multiple informal tags with the same name,
whether they are public or private.  However each tag
has an unique identifier ([guid](../guid.md)) that is
used when attaching tags to resources to ensure
the correct tag is attached.
