# Master data manager

A master data manager is a capability in a software server to manage an authoritative
collection of master data, typically about people, organizations, products and accounts.

Master data managers that hold information about the people and organizations using open metadata
integrate their data through the [Community Profile OMAS](../../../community-profile).
