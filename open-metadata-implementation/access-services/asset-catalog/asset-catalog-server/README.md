The Asset Catalog OMAS server supports the server side implementation of the access service.This includes the 

* interaction with the [administration services](../../../admin-services) for
    registration, configuration, initialization and termination of the access service.
* interaction with the [repository services](../../../repository-services) to work with open metadata from the
    [cohort](../../../repository-services/docs/open-metadata-repository-cohort.md).
* audit log used to define the message content for the OMRS Audit Log.
* service package that provides the server-side implementation of the Asset Catalog Open Metadata Assess Service (OMAS).
These services provide the functionality to fetch asset's header, classification, properties and relationships.
