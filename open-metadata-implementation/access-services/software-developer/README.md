# Software Developer Open Metadata Access Service (OMAS)

The Software Developer OMAS provides APIs and events for software developer
tools and applications that help developers make good use of the
standards and best practices defined for the data landscape.

For example, it supports search for data structure implementation snippets
based on search criteria such as glossary terms and/or language.

It also provides information about the most appropriate data sources
to use for particular situations.
