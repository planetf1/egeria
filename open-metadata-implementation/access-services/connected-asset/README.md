# Connected Asset Open Metadata Access Service (OMAS)

The Connected Asset OMAS implements the ConnectedAssetProperties API that is
available on every **[Open Connector Framework (OCF)](../../frameworks/open-connector-framework/README.md) connector**.

An OCF connector has 3 APIs:
* An API to return properties about the connector and its connection
* An API to access the asset it connects to
* An API to access the metadata about the asset the connector is used to access

The Connected Asset OMAS supports the third API on an OCF connector - the one for the metadata about the asset.
It is a generic API for all types of open metadata assets.  However, it assumes the
asset's metadata model inherits from **Asset**
(see [model 0010 in Area 0](../../../open-metadata-publication/website/open-metadata-types/0010-Base-Model.md)).

The Connected Asset OMAS returns metadata about the asset at three levels of detail:

* `getAssetSummary` - returns the summary information organized in the `assetSummary` structure.
* `getAssetDetail` - returns detailed information about the asset organized in the `assetDetail` structure.
* `getAssetUniverse` - returns all of the common metadata properties connected to the asset such as its
schema, meanings and platform.

These structures are defined in the OCF module as POJO property objects (aka beans).

The module structure for the Connected Asset OMAS is as follows:

* [connected-asset-client](connected-asset-client) supports the client library.
* [connected-asset-api](connected-asset-api) supports the common Java classes that are used both by the client and the server.
* [connected-asset-server](connected-asset-server) supports in implementation of the access service and its related event management.
* [connected-asset-spring](connected-asset-spring) supports the REST API using the [Spring](../../../developer-resources/Spring.md) libraries.
