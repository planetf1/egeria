# Connected Asset Open Metadata Access Service (OMAS) client

The Connected Asset OMAS supports a REST API for requests for asset metadata.
This client package provides language-specific client packages that plug
directly into OCF Connector implementations in order to support the
`getConnectedAssetProperties()` method.
