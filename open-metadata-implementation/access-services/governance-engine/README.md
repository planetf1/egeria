# Governance Engine Open Metadata Access Service (OMAS)

The Governance Engine OMAS provides APIs and events that retrieve and
manage metadata for governance engines.  Governance engines ensure that 
the infrastructure supporting the data landscape is operating according
to the governance program.

For example, the governance engine may be ensuring that individuals and servers
only have access to the data they have been authorized to see.
