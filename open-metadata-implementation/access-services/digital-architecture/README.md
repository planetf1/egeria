# Digital Architecture Open Metadata Access Service (OMAS)

The Digital Architecture OMAS provides APIs for tools and applications managing the
design of data structures, software and the IT infrastructure that supports the
operations of the organization.

At its heart is the notion of a **[digital service]()* that provides digital capability
either through APIs, event interchange or data feeds.

The module structure for the Digital Architecture OMAS is as follows:

* [digital-architecture-client](digital-architecture-client) supports the client library.
* [digital-architecture-api](digital-architecture-api) supports the common Java classes that are used both by the client and the server.
* [digital-architecture-server](digital-architecture-server) supports in implementation of the access service and its related event management.
* [digital-architecture-spring](digital-architecture-spring) supports the REST API using the [Spring](../../../developer-resources/Spring.md) libraries.
