# Project Management Open Metadata Access Service (OMAS)

The Project Management OMAS provides APIs and events for tools and applications
focused on managing information about the governance projects in progress
and the metadata they are managing.  It supports the planning and execution
of metadata changes as well as providing an overview of the status of
the current governance project.
