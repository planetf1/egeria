# Submit a report

An external tool can submit a report metadata representation. The request must contain also the registration guid of the external tool, obtained when the tool initially registered.
The report metadata representation can only be updated by the owning tool, meaning the registration guid must match the one used at initial creation step.
An example of a metadata representation of the report can be seen in [reportDiagram](ReportDiagramExample.png)
