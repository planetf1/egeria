# Origin identifier requirement

The open metadata standards defines a getServerOrigin
operation (`../open-metadata/admin-services/users/{userId}/server-origin`).
This operation returns an origin descriptor.
Typically this identifies the vendor, product name and version of the server.
It is useful to administrators to be able to validate the platform that is running.

This is the test case that validates whether the operation is present.
