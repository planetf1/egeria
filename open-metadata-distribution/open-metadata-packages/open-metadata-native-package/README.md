# Open Metadata Native Package	

The **open-metadata-native-package** provides a library of components to
build a metadata repository and tools package that natively supports
the Open Metadata and Governance APIs.
It includes the open metadata type system,
plus the Open Metadata Repository Services (OMRS).  
The OMRS includes the capability to join an open metadata repository cohort. 

This package supports the development of metadata repositories that
implement the **[Native Integration Pattern](../../../open-metadata-publication/website/open-metadata-integration-patterns/native-integration-pattern.md)**.
