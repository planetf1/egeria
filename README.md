# Egeria - Open Metadata and Governance
  
Egeria provides the Apache 2.0 licensed open metadata and governance
type system, frameworks,
APIs, event payloads and interchange protocols to enable tools,
engines and platforms to exchange metadata in order to get the best
value from data whilst ensuring it is properly governed.
More information on open metadata and governance can be found
here: https://odpi.github.io/data-governance/Open-Metadata-and-Governance.

## Egeria content organization
  
The Egeria content is organized into the following modules:

* **developer-resources** - contains useful files and documentation for an egeria developer.
* **open-metadata-implementation** - implementation of standards, frameworks and connectors.
* **open-metadata-compliance-suite** - implementation of the tests that determine if a vendor
or open source technology is compliant with the open metadata and governance standards.
* **open-metadata-demos** - provides demonstrations of the open metadata standards to
prove out their capabilities and provide education for newcomers.
* **open-metadata-distribution** - contains scripts to extract the completed artifacts from
the other modules and stores them together to make it easy to find them.
* **open-metadata-publication** - contains scripts that send artifacts collected together by the
open-metadata-distribution module to external parties.
* **open-metadata-resources** - contains the open metadata demos and samples.

This content is maintained by the Egeria community.
To understand how to join and contribute see the 
[Community Guide](https://github.com/odpi/egeria/developer-resources/Developer-Guidelines.md).
