# Release 1.11 (Planned August 2020)

Release 1.11 adds support for:
   * Project management of IT change
   * IoT and large scale cohorts

Below are the highlights:

* There is a new access service called the [Project Management OMAS](../open-metadata-implementation/access-services/project-management)
  provides support for projects, task tracking and to dos.
  It is designed to integrate with project management tools and link the progress of work with the governance requirements and outcomes.

* The [Open Metadata Repository Services (OMRS)](../open-metadata-implementation/repository-services)
  have been enhanced to scale to hundreds of members of the open metadata
  cohort.

* There are new [tutorials](../open-metadata-resources/open-metadata-tutorials),
  [hands-on labs](../open-metadata-resources/open-metadata-labs),
  [samples](../open-metadata-resources/open-metadata-samples) and
  [open metadata archives](../open-metadata-resources/open-metadata-archives) demonstrating
  these new capabilities of Egeria.
