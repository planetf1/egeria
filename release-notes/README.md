# ODPi Egeria Release Notes

Below are the official releases of ODPi Egeria.  The project aims to
produce a new release about once a month.  Each release includes
new features and fixes to existing function.  The team aims to
provide complete backward compatibility from release to release.
If this is not possible, it will be called out explicitly in the
release notes with an explanation on how to upgrade.
Each release will also upgrade the level of its dependencies to
ensure Egeria is running with all of the latest security patches.
We therefore recommend that you keep moving forward with us to
get the best Egeria experience possible.

One way you can help us is to feedback on your experiences, both good
and bad.  We would love to hear from you.

## Latest Release

Below are the release notes for the latest ODPi Egeria release:

* [Release 1.1 (October 2019)](release-notes-1-1.md)
    * Multi-tenant OMAG Server Platform
    * JanusGraph based metadata repository

## Older Releases

* [Release 1.0 (February 2019)](release-notes-1-0.md)
    * Peer-to-peer metadata exchange


## Future Releases

Our master branch is currently taking code for all future releases.
Many of the features are large and the teams integrate code for
partial function as soon as it is stable and has no impact on released function.
So you will see support for much more function than is officially released.
This way you can monitor and feedback on future items as they are developed.
