# Release 1.0 (February 2019)

Release 1.0 provides the open metadata integration and exchange between
metadata repositories:

* The [Open Connector Framework (OCF)](../open-metadata-implementation/frameworks/open-connector-framework)
  provides standard interfaces for implementing connectors.  These are used
  to access the data stored in [Assets](../open-metadata-implementation/access-services/docs/concepts/assets)
  and to plug in platform capabilities into the Open Metadata Repository Services (OMRS).

* The implementation of the [Open Metadata Repository Services (OMRS)](../open-metadata-implementation/repository-services).
  The repository services provide support for the [open metadata types](../open-metadata-publication/website/open-metadata-types),
  the interfaces used by a repository technology the wants to support the
  open metadata protocols, the event management for open metadata replication
  and the cohort registration and management.
  
  The repository services can be used as embeddable libraries
  in technologies that wish to participate in an
  [open metadata repository cohort](../open-metadata-implementation/repository-services/docs/open-metadata-repository-cohort.md).
