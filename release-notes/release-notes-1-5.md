# Release 1.5 (Planned February 2020)

Release 1.5 delivers the automatic metadata discovery of duplicate assets.

## Released Components

* The first governance server is released:
  * The [Discovery Server](../open-metadata-implementation/governance-servers/discovery-engine-services) supports the scanning of assets and the notification when duplicate suspects are detected.
  
  This server is supported by: 
   * The [Discovery Engine OMAS](../open-metadata-implementation/access-services/discovery-engine) supports the detection, recording and notification of exceptions and duplicate suspects.

   * The [Open Discovery Framework (ODF)](../open-metadata-implementation/frameworks/open-discovery-framework) is now defined and
     implemented to support the interfaces for automated discovery services.
     It complements the [Open Connector Framework (OCF)](../open-metadata-implementation/frameworks/open-connector-framework) delivered in release 1.0.

* There are new [tutorials](../open-metadata-resources/open-metadata-tutorials),
  [hands-on labs](../open-metadata-resources/open-metadata-labs) and
  [samples](../open-metadata-resources/open-metadata-samples) demonstrating
  the new de-duplication detection features.
