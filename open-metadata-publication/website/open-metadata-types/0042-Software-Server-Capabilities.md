# 0042 Software Server Capabilities

Within a software server are many capabilities.
These range from full applications (see 0240 in Area 2)
to security plugins to logging and encryption libraries.
Different organizations and tools can choose the granularity
in which the capabilities are captured in order to provide appropriate
context to data assets and the decisions made around them.
