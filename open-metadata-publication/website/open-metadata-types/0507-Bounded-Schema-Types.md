# 507 Bounded Schema Types (deprecated)

Bounded schema types define elements where there is a repeating structure.
Examples include sets and arrays.

These have been deprecated in favor of representing such information directly
as part of a [SchemaAttribute](0505-Schema-Attributes.md)'s properties.
