# 0421 Governance Confidentiality

Most organizations already define their standard levels of confidentiality.
This entity is used to describe one of these levels.
An organization creates one of these entities for each of their confidentiality levels.
The level value is used by security processing to,
for example, compare the confidentiality of an asset against a person's access.
