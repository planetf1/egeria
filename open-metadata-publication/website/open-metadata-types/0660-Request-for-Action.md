# 0660 Request for Action

A request for action (RfA) is used to trigger the
[Governance Action Framework (GAF)](../../../open-metadata-implementation/frameworks/governance-action-framework/README.md).
It is used when the discovery service performs a test on the
data (such as a discovery rule) or has discovered an anomaly in
the data landscape compared to its metadata that potentially needs
a steward or a curator's action.
The governance action framework is configured to
respond to the requests for actions (RfAs).
