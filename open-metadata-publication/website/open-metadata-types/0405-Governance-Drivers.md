# 0405 Governance Drivers

Governance Drivers provide the core requirements of the governance program.
The **GovernanceStrategy** is derived from the business strategy.
It defines how the governance program supports the business strategy.
**Regulations** define relevant legal requirements relating to the business operation.

Reconciling the governance strategy with the regulations creates synergies
in an organization's approach to governance.
