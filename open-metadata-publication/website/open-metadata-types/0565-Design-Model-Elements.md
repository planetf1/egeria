# 0565 Model Elements

Models are used during the development of schema and their
related software to provide templates and abstractions
of the implementation.

We add representations of models to the metadata repository
to help organize and explain data assets - particularly when
they are complex, or the schema is not available.

Model 0565 shows the definition of a generic model element.
This is specialized to define the concept model element and its three main
subtypes:

* ConceptBead - an entity structure for a concept in a data-oriented model.
* ConceptBeadAttribute - an attribute of the concept bead.
* ConceptBead link - a relationship between two concept beads.
