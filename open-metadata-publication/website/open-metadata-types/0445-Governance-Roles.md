# 0445 Governance Roles

Although we aim to automate governance as much as possible, it is often necessary to
assign responsibility for specific actions to specific people.

In Figure 1, the responsibilities of someone assigned to managed a
particular aspect of governing a resource ([Referenceable](0010-Base-Model.md))
is represented by a GovernanceRole entity.  The person assigned to
do the work is then linked to the Governance Role.
