# 0603 Open Discovery Pipelines

[Open discovery pipelines](../../../open-metadata-implementation/frameworks/open-discovery-framework/docs/discovery-pipeline.md)
are specialized [open discovery services](../../../open-metadata-implementation/frameworks/open-discovery-framework/docs/discovery-service.md)
that execute multiple open discovery services in a single run.

The OpenDiscoveryPipeline describes an open discovery pipeline.
It is typically linked to a [VirtualConnection](0205-Connection-Linkage.md) with the
connections of the open discovery services embedded within it.
