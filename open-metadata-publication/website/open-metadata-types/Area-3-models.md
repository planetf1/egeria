# Area 3 Models - Glossary and Semantics

Area 3 describes the glossary.

This enables the definition of meanings and the relationships
between different types of terminology.
Most definitions are created through a manual process,
however, this definition may occur in a different
tool and be replicated automatically into other metadata
repositories.

There can be multiple glossaries in the metadata repositories.  Each glossary owns a set of glossary terms and (optionally) a category hierarchy.  Glossary terms can be linked into none, one or many categories, from any glossary.  Similarly, terms from different glossaries may have relationships linking them together.
This is the definitions of terms and concepts and how
they relate to one another.

Linking the concepts/terms defined in the glossary
to the data assets in [Area 2](Area-2-models.md), defines the meaning of the
data that is managed by the data assets.
This is a key relationship that helps people locate and
understand the data assets they are working with.
