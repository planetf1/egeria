# Open Metadata and Governance (OMAG) Server

An OMAG server is a software server that supports one or more Open Metadata and Governance (OMAG)
subsystems.  The subsystems that are activated in an OMAG server are defined in its
[Configuration Document](../../../open-metadata-implementation/admin-services/docs/concepts/configuration-document.md).

The OMAG Server runs in one or more [OMAG Server Platforms](.).  When it is started, the operational services
of the OMAG Server Platform reads the configuration document and activates the OMAG Server with the requested services.

There is more information about OMAG Servers and how to configure them in the
[Administration Guide](../../../open-metadata-implementation/admin-services/docs/concepts/omag-server.md)
