# Egeria Road Map and Destination

Egeria is a large project with many different activities
adding content to the project.   This page provides an overview
of the aims of the project and a reflection of where we are today.

Figure 1 shows the three layers of capability that
Egeria is aiming for.

> **Figure 1:** Three layers of capability for Egeria

Although some progress has been made on all layers,
they do build on one another.
So, not surprisingly, most of the work has been focused on
establishing the frameworks, connector APIs and other
services to provide the developer toolkit.

In recent months, and going into 2020, our focus is
shifting to the integration platform as we add
connector implementations for popular third party
technologies and expand out the governance servers.

The support for the governance solution will then naturally
follow along.

Follow the links for more information about the
three layers:
