# Asset Consumer OMAS FVT Suite

The Asset Consumer OMAS FVT Suite focuses initially on driving the 
[AssetConsumer](../../../../open-metadata-implementation/access-services/asset-consumer/asset-consumer-client/docs/user/java-client)
Java client through the
full range of its API calls both with the server activated and with it not present.

It uses an OMAG Server configured with the in-memory repository.
To run the test, start the server and call the test suite as follows:

```bash
$ AssetConsumerOMASFVTSuite serverURLRoot
```

Where:

* `serverURLRoot` is the hostname and port name for the OMAG Server.  For example: `http://localhost:8080`
