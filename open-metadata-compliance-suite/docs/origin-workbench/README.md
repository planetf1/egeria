# Open Metadata Origin Test Workbench

The open metadata origin test workbench is responsible for testing that an open metadata repository
is able to support the `server-origin` API.

The workbench uses the server-origin API to extract the servers origin description.
Typically this describes the vendor, product name and version of the server.
